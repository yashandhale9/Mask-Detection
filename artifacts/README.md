# 🧠 Artifacts Folder — Mask Detection Project

This folder stores all the trained model files, evaluation plots, and related outputs generated during training.

---

## 📦 Contents

| File / Folder | Description |
|----------------|--------------|
| **best_model.h5** | Model checkpoint saved during training with highest validation accuracy. |
| **mask_detector_model.h5** | Final trained model after fine-tuning (used in real-time detection). |
| **mask_detector_model.tflite** | Lightweight TensorFlow Lite version for mobile or low-end devices. |
| **training_curves.png** | Graph showing model accuracy and loss across epochs. |
| **confusion_matrix.png** | Heatmap of model performance across all 3 classes. |
| **augmentation_samples.png** | Example images after applying data augmentation. |

## 📝 Notes
- All these files are auto-generated by `face_mask_train.py` during training.  
- Use `mask_detector_model.h5` for desktop real-time detection.  
- Use `mask_detector_model.tflite` for mobile or embedded deployment.  
- Do **not** edit or delete these files manually unless retraining the model.
